# published by hand without the fixed-name disk image, which silently broke the download
# link in the README for everyone — the kind of step that only gets forgotten once it is
# a step at all.

# Usage: ./release.sh [version]
#   With no argument, releases whatever version Resources/Info.plist already carries.
